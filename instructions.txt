Welcome to our Simple Back Up Solutions.

What does it do?
================
This is a very simple and basic app that allows you to
select
(i) Source Folder: a folder that you want to back up (take a copy of), and
(ii) Backup Folder: the folder that you want to save the copy to

(i) New files: The app will copy new files from the Source Folder onto the
Backup Folder.
(ii) Existing files: The app will look at the files on both the Source and
the Backup Folder and will work out whether there are files in your Source
Folder that are more recent than their version in the Backup Folder. If so,
it will back up the more recent version from your Source Folder onto your
Backup Folder.

This will delete the old version in your Backup Folder. If you don't want
to delete the older version in your Backup Folder you need to RENAME either
the more recent file in your Source Folder or the old version in your
Backup Folder. That way, the app considers these different files and will
copy the more recent file from the Source Folder onto the Backup Folder
as a new file.
For example, MyLetter.txt is a file that exists on both your Source and
Backup Folders. Comparing the date on which both files were last modified
the app sees that MyLetter.txt was updated more recently in the Source Folder
and that therefore a backup needs to be performed. It will therefore replace
MyLetter.txt on the Backup folder (the older version) with the new version
from the Source Folder, so that both Folders now have the more recent version,
or in other words, your most recent version is backed up on the Backup Folder.
Crucially, the older version that used to sit on the Backup Folder has been
replaced, so the older version has been deleted.
If you want to preserve the older version you need to rename either the more
recent version in the Source Folder or the older version in the Backup Folder
BEFORE PERFORMING THE BACKUP, of course. For example, you could rename the older
version in the Backup Folder to MyLetter_old_version.txt, or rename the more
recent version to something useful such as MyLetter_20230105.txt referring to
the date this letter was created or updated, iin this case 5 Jan 2023.
(a small side note)
Why did I use this weir format of the date? Because this date format also works
alphabetically, meaning, in your folder, where files are shown in alphabetical
order by default, files of an earlier date will show up at the top, because
20221231 alphabetically comes before 20230105. This doesn't work if you use
5 January 2023 and 31 December 2022.
(end of side note)
With your file now renamed, the app will consider this a new file and therefore
doesn't delete the old version.

How to use the app?
===================

Welcome Screen
--------------
Here we show the mos recent date when you last performed a backup. You should
back up very regularly. With our little app you could easily do this every day.

This screen gives you 5 options via 5 buttons:
1. Take Back Up: click to go to the next step in the backup process: selecting
the Source and Backup Folders
2. See Backup Log: Check you entire back up history.
3. Clear Backup Log: clear your log in case it gets too long
4. Help: takes you to the help screen you're looking at now
5. Close the app

When selecting the first option, the app takes you through the following steps:

Previous Selection Screen
the from (=Source) and to (=Backup) folders that were chosen last time are shown
here. Usually users backup the same folder over and over again. You can choose to
'Use Current Selection' or 'Select New Folders'.
If you select 'Use Current Selection' your backup will start and results will be
shown until backup is complete. This ends the process.
When you choose to 'Select New Folders', we go to the next step.

Select Source Folder Screen
Your folders appear. Select the folder you want to back up, i.e. your
SOURCE FOLDER. You can double-click on the folders to go one level deeper.
Then click 'Confirm Selection' to go to the next step.

Select Backup Folder Screen
Your folders appear again. Select the folder you want to back up TO, i.e. your
BACKUP FOLDER. You can double-click on the folders to go one level deeper.
Then click 'Confirm Selection' to go to the next step.
Your backup will start and results will be shown until backup is complete.
This ends the process.
